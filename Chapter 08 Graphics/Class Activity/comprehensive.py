# "Earthquake Monitoring and Analysis"
# You are part of a research team studying seismic activities. Over a 24-hour period, you
# collected the following data from a seismic station:
# 1. Seismic signal amplitude (A) recorded every second for 60 seconds during a
# minor earthquake.
# 2. Energy released (E) during 10 major tremors over the day.
# 3. Sound intensity (L) recorded hourly from ambient noise.
# 4. Frequency response (f) of the station's sensors to different frequencies.
# 5. Magnitude distribution (M) of 100 earthquakes in a simulated model.
# 6. Sensor measurements (X) from two regions (North and South).
# You need to analyze and visualize this data using all the plotting techniques listed
