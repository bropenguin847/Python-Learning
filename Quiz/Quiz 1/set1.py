Set 1 
A company records the monthly water consumption (in cubic meters) for 8 apartments over 
a year. The data is stored in a Excel file named water_consumption.xlsx: 
1. Write a Python script to load the data from water_consumption.xlsx and perform 
polynomial curve fitting for Apartment_5 using polynomial orders 1, 2, and 3.
2. Using the fitted models, predict the water consumption for Apartment_5 for the next 
three months (January, February, and March of the following year).
3. Create a user interface for the users to select which order they want to display in the 
graph. Example; order 1 or order 2 or order 3 or order 1,2 and 3.
4. Plot the original data and overlay the polynomial fitting curves on the same graph 
based on user selection.
Using the best-fit polynomial model from above, calculate and display the predicted water 
consumption for Apartment_5 for the first, second, and third months of the following year.
