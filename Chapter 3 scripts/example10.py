# Relational Operators in Python

# Define sample variables
a = 5
b = 10

# Relational operations
less_than = a < b          # Less than
less_equal = a <= b        # Less than or equal
equal = a == b             # Equal
not_equal = a != b         # Not equal
greater_than = a > b       # Greater than
greater_equal = a >= b     # Greater than or equal

# Print results
print("a =", a)
print("b =", b)
print("a < b:", less_than)           # Output: True
print("a <= b:", less_equal)         # Output: True
print("a == b:", equal)              # Output: False
print("a != b:", not_equal)          # Output: True
print("a > b:", greater_than)        # Output: False
print("a >= b:", greater_equal)      # Output: False
