Problem Statement:
You are provided with a dataset that records the monthly temperatures and precipitacion levels of
three cities over a five-year period. The goal is to use Python to clean, analyze, visualize, and build a
predictive model to forecast future temperature and precipitation levels. With the knowledge of
scientific programming, you are required to WRITE THE SCRIPT for each task together with comment
that explain the code.

Task 1: Data Cleaning Process
a) Inspect the provided dataset for missing values and outliers. Document the number of missing
values and outline your strategy for handling them using Python libraries such as pandas.
b) Implement the cleaning steps in Python, including filling missing values using appropriate
techniques (e.g., mean, median, or interpolation) and removing or handling outliers.
Task 2: Descriptive Data Analysis
a) Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for the temperature and
precipitation data of each city. What do these statistics tell you about the distribution of data
for each city?
b) Analyze the relationship between temperature and precipitation using a correlation
coefficient. What can you conclude from this analysis?
Task 3: Data Visualization
a) Create visualizations that represent the distribution of temperature and precipitation over
time for each city (e.g., line plots or histograms). Include commentary on any observed trends
or patterns.
b) Construct a comparative plot (e.g., a multi-line chart) to illustrate the temperature trends
across all three cities. Highlight any seasonal variations or trends you identify.
Task 4: Predictive Analysis
a) Develop a predictive model using linear regression to forecast future temperatures and
precipitation levels based on historical data. Explain your choice of model and preprocessing
steps.
b) Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics such as R-squared or mean absolute
error (MAE). What do these metrics indicate about the model's predictive accuracy?
