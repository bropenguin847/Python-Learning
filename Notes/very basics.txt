Basic Coding Vocabulary

General Web Development:
* Server: A computer that hosts website codes, and "serves" a website code upon requested by "client" computer.
            Usually sit in large warehouses with thousands of other servers that are similar in size and computation power
* Client: A computer used to access websites
            Example: tablet, computer, laptop, phone
* Designer: An artistic professional that decides how a website will look and feel, along with the ways users will interact with the website
            For example, clicking, swiping, scrolling, and so on.
            Basically designing the User Interface (UI)
* Wireframe: An illustration created by designers that show in detail a website's layouts, images, and color schemes.
* Developer: An engineering professional who writes code to turn wireframes into useable websites.
            Based on the type of code written, developers are referred to as front-end, back-end, or full stack.
* Front-end: Everything you can see and click in a browser. Front-end developers write code in front-end languages
            like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website appearance.
* Back-end: Everything that happens behind-the-scenes to make the front-end perform as intended.
            Back-end developers write code in back-end languages like Ruby or Python to create functionality
            like logging in users, storing user preferences, and retrieving data like comments on a photo.

Terms related to front-end languages:
* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): A language used to place text, images, and other content on a webpage.
* HTML tag: HTML instructions, usually appearing in pairs. Browsers apply special effects to text between an opening <element&gt; and closing </element&gt; HTML tag.
    For instance, the <h1&gt; tag renders in a browser as a large bolded headline and can be used like this: <h1>Dewey beats Truman</h1>.
* HTML attribute: Attributes or parameters for HTML tags that modify the tag's behavior. Attributes are always placed in the opening HTML tag.
    For example, href is the attribute in the following anchor tag (used to create hyperlinks): <a href="http://www.google.com">Search engine</a>

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Code that modifies HTML on webpages and that controls the appearance of content by
    changing text size, image size, and other attributes.
* JavaScript: Code that adds interactivity and animation to webpages.
    JavaScript also detects browser events such as mouse clicks, validates user input such as text entries,
    and retrieves data from external websites.
    
* Variable: A storage of data that have a name and contains data for use in coding.
* If statement (conditional): A code instruction that tests a condition that usually includes variables
    such as x < 18, and executes code you write when the condition is true.
* Function: A name given to a group of programming statements for easy reference and use.
* Loops: A function that repeats until a condition is met

Terms related to back-end languages:
* Ruby: An open-source programming language best known for use in web programming.
* Rails: A framework designed to make creating webpages with Ruby easy.
* Python: An open-source programming language used on the web, in scientific applications, and for data analysis.
