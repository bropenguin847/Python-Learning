![python_logo](python-logo-only.png)
For **Scientific Programming Course** which introduces the fundamentals of scientific programming languages. Emphasis is placed on fundamentals of programming, implementing algorithms, program design and visualization. The goal is to learn the skills in scientific computing, tools, techniques that can be used to solve engineering problems. This course uses Python as its high level programming language with various libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib, with VS Code as IDE.

# **Notes**
Contains notes for each chapter.

# **Exercises**
In exercises folder, contain exercises for python, such as array manipulation, bubble sort and my mistakes that I have made during test.
Some python files are combined together to reduce clutter and because the code is very similar

# Scripts
In Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, contains example code for each chapter. Can try out and find out how does each function work.
In Chapter 8, the folder for Signals is for Signals and System course. It's for assignment, the code is an alternative to plotting graphs using MatLab
