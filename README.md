# Python Learning 🚀
![python_logo](python-logo-only.png =250x250)<br>
For **Scientific Programming Course** which introduces the fundamentals of Scientific Programming.
Emphasis is placed on fundamentals of programming, implementing algorithms, 
program design and visualization. The goal is to learn the skills in scientific computing,
tools, techniques that can be used to solve engineering problems.
<br>
There are 12 chapters in Scientific Programming course:
- Chapter 1: Overview of Languages
- Chapter 2: Introduction to Programming Platform (Python)
- Chapter 3: Complex Data Type
- Chapter 4: Control FLow
- Chapter 5: Functions
- Chapter 6: Input & Output
- Chapter 7: Debugging [Excluded]
- Chapter 8: Graphics
- Chapter 9: Data Interpolation
- Chapter 10: Polynomials
- Chapter 11: Data Analytics
- Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) [Excluded]
The notes for the excluded slides will still be provided
<br>

This course uses Python as its high level programming language with various libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib, with [VSCode as IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). However, a few setups are required when programming Python using VSCode. [Here are the steps.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

Alternatively, [SpyderIDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) can be used. It is easy to use and comes prebuilt with libraries and many features such as plotting, variable table and interactive window.


This repo is currently used as my personal notes, with scripts to aid my learning.

I would like to keep this as my way of learning how to maintain a repo, make documentation that is neat and user friendly.

In the future, perhaps I will make a wiki page for all the shortcuts to learn Python.

# [**Notes** ✍️](https://github.com/bropenguin847/Python-Learning/tree/main/Notes)
Contains notes for each chapter. Notes will be continually updated.
For array notes, contain specific notes regarding numpy arrays, numpy functions and so on.
Further references can be found in the appendix.

# [**Exercises** ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ](https://github.com/bropenguin847/Python-Learning/tree/main/exercises)
In exercises folder, contain exercises for python, such as array manipulation, bubble sort 
and my mistakes that I have made during my tests (regretting life).

# [Assignment 📚](https://github.com/bropenguin847/Python-Learning/tree/main/Assignment)
In the assignment folder, contains 3 tasks. All requires using Python to extract data from csv file using Python libraries such as Pandas.

In all the .py file, the problem scenario's are stated on the top.
datastat_module is a custom Python file that contains all the functions that can help out with the other files. It is essentially a custom library.

For the data in Assignment, outliers and missing values have been added in the .csv files

# Scripts 📝
All the folders labeled with Chapter contain scripts for each chapter. Some have xlsx or csv files used as data. Feel free to try it out.

Some Python files are combined together to reduce clutter and because the codes are very similar.
Such as example1&2 are combination of example1 and example2 in Chapter 4.

In Chapter 8, the folder 'Signals' is for Signals and System course. It's a requirement for my assignment, the code is an alternative to plotting graphs using MatLab.

Chapter 7 (Debugging) and Chapter 12 (OOP) is not included in this repo, but I will try to find the notes for both of those chapter.
