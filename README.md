# Python Learning 🚀
![python_logo](python-logo-only.png =250x250)<br>
For **Scientific Programming Course** which introduces the fundamentals of Scientific Programming. Emphasis is placed on fundamentals of programming, implementing algorithms, program design and visualization. The goal is to learn the skills in scientific computing, tools, techniques that can be used to solve engineering problems.
<br>
There are 12 chapters in Scientific Programming course:
- Chapter 1: Overview of Languages
- Chapter 2: Introduction to Programming Platform (Python)
- Chapter 3: Complex Data Type
- Chapter 4: Control FLow
- Chapter 5: Functions
- Chapter 6: Input & Output
- Chapter 7: Debugging [Excluded]
- Chapter 8: Graphics
- Chapter 9: Data Interpolation
- Chapter 10: Polynomials
- Chapter 11: Data Analytics
- Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) [Excluded]
The notes for the excluded slides will still be provided

This course uses Python as its high level programming language with various libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib, with VS Code as IDE.
Initially, this repo was used as my personal note taking during class, with scipts to aid my learning.
Now, I want to learn to maintain a github repo through this. Hopefully I can make this neat and user friendly for myself and my future viewers.

# [**Notes** ✍️](https://github.com/bropenguin847/Python-Learning/tree/main/Notes)
Contains notes for each chapter. Still updating the notes, when I have time.
For array notes, contain specific notes regarding numpy arrays, numpy functions and so on.

# [**Exercises** ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ](https://github.com/bropenguin847/Python-Learning/tree/main/exercises)
In exercises folder, contain exercises for python, such as array manipulation, bubble sort and my mistakes that I have made during test (regretting life).
Some python files are combined together to reduce clutter and because the codes are very similar.
Such as example1&2 are combination of example1 and example2.

# [Assignment 📚](https://github.com/bropenguin847/Python-Learning/tree/main/Assignment)
In the assignment folder, contains 3 tasks. All requires using Python to extract data from csv file using Python libraries such as Pandas.
In all the .py file, the problem scenario's are stated on the top.
datastat_module is a custom .py file that contains all the functions that can help out with the other files.

# Scripts 📝
In Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, contains example code for each chapter. Can try out and find out how does each function work.
In Chapter 8, the folder for Signals is for Signals and System course. It's for assignment, the code is an alternative to plotting graphs using MatLab.
Chapter 7 (Debugging) and Chapter 12 (OOP) is not included in this repo, but I will try to find the notes for both of those chapter.

# Libraries 📖
Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas & SciPy. With documentation links provided as well.
```python
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install pandas
python -m pip install scipy
```
